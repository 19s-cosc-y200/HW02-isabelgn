Here is a little bit about myself: 
    <br>
    Isabel is a 20 year old singer from Newton, MA just outside of Boston who has been singing for as long as she can remember. Around the age of five she began piano lessons after several years watching her sister have lessons and wishing it was her. She continues to play piano up to this day with the same joy she experienced as a small child. At 13 years old she saved up to buy herself a guitar and found someone to teach her lessons and at 16 added the Ukulele to her repertoire. Currently she is a junior studying Popular and Commercial Music at Loyola University New Orleans with a mix of business, technology and performance courses.
